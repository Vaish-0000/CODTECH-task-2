Overview of the Project: Docker Containerization
Project Title: Docker Containerization for Web Application

Objective: The main goal of this project is to containerize a simple web application using Docker to create a portable, isolated, and consistent environment for running the application across different machines or environments. Docker allows us to define the environment, including all necessary dependencies, in a container, making the application easily deployable and scalable.

In this project, we will:

Containerize a simple web application (e.g., a Flask app) using Docker.
Learn how to create a Dockerfile that defines the app's environment.
Build a Docker image from the Dockerfile.
Run the application inside a Docker container locally.
Expose the application to the outside world via a specific port.
Explore how Docker simplifies development, testing, and deployment of web applications.
What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside containers. A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

Key benefits of Docker include:

Portability: Containers can run consistently across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
Isolation: Each container is isolated from the host system and other containers, allowing for easy management of dependencies.
Scalability: Docker enables easy scaling of applications by creating and running multiple containers.
Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and fast because they share the host system's OS kernel
